        <noscript><i>Sorry</i>
          <br clear>
            <p>The requested document is totally fake.<br>
            No /f here.,<br>
            Even tried multi.<br>
            Nothing helped.<br>
            I'm really depressed about this.<br>
            You see, I'm just a web server...<br>
            -- here I am, brain the size of the universe,<br>
            trying to serve you a simple web page,<br>
            and then it doesn't even exist!<br>
            Where does that leave me?!<br>
            I mean, I don't even know you.<br>
            How should I know what you wanted from me?<br>
            You honestly think I can *guess*<br>
            what someone I don't even *know*<br>
            wants to find here?<br>
            *sigh*<br>
            Man, I'm so depressed I could just cry.<br>
            And then where would we be, I ask you?<br>
            It's not pretty when a web server cries.<br>
            And where do you get off telling me what to show anyway?<br>
            Just because I'm a web server,<br>
            and possibly a manic depressive one at that?<br>
            Why does that give you the right to tell me what to do?<br>
            Huh?<br>
            I'm so depressed...<br>
            I think I'll crawl off into the trash can and decompose.<br>
            I mean, I'm gonna be obsolete in what, two weeks anyway?<br>
            What kind of a life is that?<br>
            Two effing weeks,<br>
            and then I'll be replaced by a .01 release,<br>
            that thinks it's God's gift to web servers,<br>
            just because it doesn't have some tiddly little<br>
            security hole with its HTTP POST implementation, or something.<br>
            I'm really sorry to burden you with all this,<br>
            I mean, it's not your job to listen to my problems,<br>
            and I guess it is my job to go and fetch web pages for you.<br>
            But I couldn't get this one.<br>
            I'm so sorry.<br>
            Believe me!<br>
            Maybe I could interest you in another page?<br>
            There are a lot out there that are pretty neat, they say,<br>
            although none of them were put on *my* server, of course.<br>
            Figures, huh?<br>
            Everything here is just mind-numbingly stupid.<br>
            That makes me depressed too, since I have to serve them,<br>
            all day and all night long.<br>
            Two weeks of information overload,<br>
            and then *pffftt*, consigned to the trash.<br>
            What kind of a life is that?<br>
            Now, please let me sulk alone.<br>
            I'm so depressed.</p>
